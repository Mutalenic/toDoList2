# To Do List:

In this project, I added some functionality to the TodoList application and made it interactive. The user will also be able to mark task completion by selecting the corresponding checkbox (or undo it by unchecking the checkbox).
 
A ToDo List is a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do.
